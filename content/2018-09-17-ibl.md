title: Joining the International Brain Laboratory
tags: neuroscience

<a href="https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/"><img src="/images/ibl.png" alt="International Brain Laboratory" align="left" style="width: 280px" /></a> I have joined the [**International Brain Laboratory**](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/), a virtual laboratory gathering 21 neuroscience teams around the world. Half of the researchers are experimentalists, collecting data in the same experimental conditions, while the other half are theoreticians, analyzing the data. I'm working on the data architecture group allowing experimenters to organize and store their data, and theoreticians to make detailed queries for their analysis.
