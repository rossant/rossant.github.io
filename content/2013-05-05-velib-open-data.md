Title: Vélib' Open Data
Tags: python, opendata

[Vélib'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9lib%27), the public bicycle
sharing system in Paris. I've written a short [IPython
notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5520933) to play with some of the
data, and to illustrate how easy it is to use Python for browsing and
analyzing public data sets. Here is an image representing the stations
in Paris, with the marker size proportional to the number of bike stands
in each station, and the color indicating how many available stands
there are. The Seine is easily recognizable, and the fact that most
stations near the river are full might be linked to the fact that this
data has been obtained on a sunny Sunday of May...
